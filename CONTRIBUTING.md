# Fontrobot Contributing Checklist

## A short list to help you get started:

* Check out [issues]() for ideas. Is someone else working on something similar?
* Fork the repo and work out of a named topic branch, a la `git checkout -b my_sweet_contribution`. Please don't work directly off `master`.
* Run tests with `guard`.
* Add/improve tests for your contributions.
* Submit a pull request!
